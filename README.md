# PyAutoGUI Project

This is my first Python project using the PyAutoGUI library.  
It automates some simple mouse and keyboard actions!

## How to use
pip Install PyAutoGUI
pip install time

Look at the "Get Position" to view the code that catch the position of the mouse for you to play with! It's fun!!
